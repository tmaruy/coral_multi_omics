Gene network analysis
-------------------------
1. **Weighted gene co-expression network analysis** 
2. **Scoring reproducibility of gene modules**

  Gene co-expression network was constructed with EBB dataset, a (closed) transcriptomic dataset acquired from postmortal human hippocampus. Gene modules were defined from the co-expression network.

  Reproducibility of the modules were evaluated by using Braineac `(Ramasamy et al.) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25174004>`__ dataset, another human hippocampal transcriptome dataset. An indicator of module reproducibility, Zsummary `(Langfelder et al.) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21283776>`__ , was utilized for the evaluation.  

  All these analyses were performed with an R package WGCNA `(Langfelder et al.) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19114008>`__ .
  EBB transcriptome dataset is not opened. Please contact us if you prefer collaboration with us.

Annoatation of gene modules

3. **Gene set analysis**
4. **Identification of AD-associated modules**
5. **Network visualization**

  Gene set analysis (GSA) was performed on the gene modules. Enrichment of four gene sets (Gene ontology, KEGG Pathway, Disease risk genes and Celltype-specific genes) were evaluated through Fisher's exact test.

  Six modules were identified as "AD-associated modules" because of their high reproducibilities (Zsummary score) and significant AD gene enrichments.

  The six modules showed associations with different functional gene sets, celltypes and diseases.
